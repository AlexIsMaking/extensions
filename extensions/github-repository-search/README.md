# GitHub Repository Search

This extension allows you to search GitHub repositories efficiently. It keeps track of visited repositories, you can jump to sub-pages like pull requests, and filter by your organizations.

## Set-Up

The extension requires a personal access token (PAT). You can generate a token in your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens/967644851). The token needs the `repo` scope and if you want to filter by organizations, you need to add the `read:org` scope.
